# Clicky Game

This is a simple web app build on [React](https://reactjs.org/) components.

## How to play
Every time the game loads, it randomizes the position of 10 hollywood actors on the screen.
Keep clicking on actors!!!

If you manage to click all 10 in 10 attempts (no actors gets clicked twice), you win the game with a max possible score of 10.
When you clicked an actor twice, you have lost and the game resets.
